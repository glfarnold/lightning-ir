-----------------

Lightning IR is a library for fine-tuning and running neural ranking models. It is built on top of `PyTorch Lightning <https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/>`_ to provide a simple and flexible interface to interact with neural ranking models.

You want to for example:

- fine-tune your own cross- or bi-encoder models?
- index and search through a collection of documents with ColBERT or SPLADE?
- re-rank documents with state-of-the-art models?

Lightning IR has you covered!

Installation
------------

Lightning IR can be installed using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install lightning-ir

Getting Started
---------------

See the `Quickstart <quickstart>`_ guide to get started with Lightning IR.
